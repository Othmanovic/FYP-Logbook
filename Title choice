- Development or Research:
I was in delimma to choose between these 2 as I really wanted to learn both. I wanted to build a whole system by myself without the help of groupmates and I also wanted to learn how to do a research.
Nevertheless, after consulting few people who have experience with this, i decided to go with development. 


- choosing the topic:
I came up with 7 potential topics and I had a discussion about them with miss Hazinah. She started eleminating the undoable or unnecessary ones one by one. Until she reached this topic
which is UTM online printing system (UTM-OPS) and she said this is doable. 

The next step is to make a proposal and submit it before th 4th of November.
